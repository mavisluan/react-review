This is a React practice repo which contains small components organized by features.
## Inputs
- ControlledInputs
   - A controlled component is a component where React is in control. Data lives in Component state instead of DOM element
   - Demo: Submit input a contact info (phone, firstName, lastName) and display the data in a list
   
- UncontrolledInputs
    - An uncontrolled component is where the form data is handled by the DOM instead of the React component.
    - Demo: Input a value and click on the button to get the value from alert
